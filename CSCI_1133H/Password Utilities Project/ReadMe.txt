Writeup for code:

I did this step-by-step, first completing the C, then B, then A level code. I personally found the C level the most difficult.

Building the basics was hard, and so was debugging. The rest of the code was pretty much just reimplementing something in slightly different ways.

I wrote a LOT of helper functions, and I've commeneted in to which function each helper function is working for.
	Note: randChar actually is a helper to generatePassword which is a helper to generateValidPassword

The way the extra credit works is by asking for a passphrase, and if a valid password can be generated from it, it returns the password. Otherwise it returns the error with the password.
	Note: The way my function runs, there is an initial argument of a pass phrase. It will check the initial one, but ask for another if the one given cannot return a password.
